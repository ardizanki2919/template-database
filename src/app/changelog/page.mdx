## Safe migrations on development branches

<ChangelogImage src="/changelog/317.png" />

Safe migrations can now be activated on development branches. Activating this
feature ensures zero-downtime schema migrations, the ability to revert schemas,
and safeguards against unintended schema modifications. Additionally,
development branches with safe migrations can now establish a workflow that
includes a "staging" branch, a capability that was previously exclusive to
production branches.

### New & Improved:

- <strong>Filters:</strong> [AI Filters](#) will now enhance your existing compatible
  filters rather than replacing them.
- <strong>Comments:</strong> When you open a notification about a comment, the reply
  input field will now automatically appear.
- <strong>Editor:</strong> It's now possible to browse through multiple images in
  the editor without needing to zoom out.
- <strong>Templates:</strong> When using an existing document to [create a template](#),
  users can now choose which team to create it in, rather than it defaulting to the
  first available team.

### Fixes:

- <strong>Dashboard:</strong> Now, when you move database projects in a list or board
  layout grouped by date within the [dashboard](#), the start and end dates will
  update automatically.
- <strong>Dashboard:</strong> The sequence of columns on dashboards organized by
  [database milestones](#) will now match the order of milestones displayed in the
  sidebar.
- <strong>Desktop Application:</strong> Fixed a glitch that allowed PDF printing
  even in the absence of connected printers.
- <strong>Help Center:</strong> Enhanced the capability for accessing documentation
  links directly from the in-app help center.
- <strong>Editor:</strong> The user mention feature in the SQL editor now respects
  the 'Display full names' setting.
- <strong>Filters:</strong> Resolved an inconsistency where filter queries with 'includes
  any' settings sometimes delivered incorrect results.

## New Regions and Replicas

<ChangelogImage src="/changelog/316.png" />

Database introduces the capability to set up same-region read replicas. These
replicas are separate, read-only compute units designed to conduct read
operations on the same dataset as their corresponding read-write compute
instances.

Use Regions to advance:

- <strong>Enhanced Throughput:</strong> Spread read operations across several replicas
  to improve throughput for all types of workloads, both read-write and read-only.
- <strong>Dedicated Read-only Workloads:</strong> Assign analytical and reporting
  tasks to a read replica to preserve the performance of your main application workload.
- <strong>Controlled Data Access:</strong> Grant read-only access to specific applications
  or users who don't require write permissions.
- <strong>Resource Customization:</strong> Tailor the CPU and memory resources for
  each read replica according to the specific requirements of different applications
  or users.
- <strong>Customization Features:</strong> Instantly create and tailor the resources
  of one or more read replicas for any project branch, adjusting the allocated vCPU
  and memory as needed.

For more information, refer to our docs post on read replicas or the read
replicas section in [the documentation](#).
